What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it creates .git folder .. i don't know why we need it

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

it only contains the file we want to commit... i do not know

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by using these commands git diff & git diff --staged
